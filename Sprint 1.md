### Hortonworks Sandbox (Hortonworks Data Platform 2.5)

Download Link: https://hortonworks.com/downloads

This is a image built for hadoop. Even though there are newer versions of the Hortonworks data platfrom Sandbox available, they require really beefy PCs to run, so in the interest of making sure we increase the odds of this actually running on your System, what we gonna do is to install an older version 2.5, and we just gonna update the individual components that needed. So the latest technology is still used.
